# Claude Code Instructions for Lockplane Todos

This file contains project-specific instructions for AI assistants working on Lockplane Todos.

## Project Overview

Lockplane Todos is a modern todo list application built with:
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: Turso (libSQL/SQLite)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with serverless functions

## üö® COMPLETE WORKFLOW CHECKLIST üö®

**WHENEVER YOU MAKE CODE CHANGES, FOLLOW THIS CHECKLIST EXACTLY:**

### Phase 1: Planning & Implementation
- [ ] Understand the requirement fully
- [ ] Identify which files need to be modified
- [ ] Make code changes

### Phase 2: Testing & Building (CRITICAL - ALWAYS TEST AND BUILD)
- [ ] Build the project: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify build succeeds with no errors
- [ ] Test in dev mode if needed: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Run linter (if configured): `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run tests (when implemented): `npm test`

### Phase 3: Schema Changes (If Applicable)
- [ ] Edit schema file in `schema/` directory
- [ ] Run `lockplane migrate` to generate and apply migrations
- [ ] Verify migration succeeded
- [ ] Stage migration files: `git add schema/ migrations/`

### Phase 4: Documentation (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
- [ ] Update `README.md` with usage changes or new features
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` if workflow changes
- [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update component JSDoc if applicable

### Phase 5: Git (CRITICAL - ALWAYS COMMIT AND PUSH)
- [ ] Check git status: `git status`
- [ ] Review changes: `git diff`
- [ ] Stage all changes: `git add .`
- [ ] Create descriptive commit message following this format:
  ```
  <short description>

  <longer description if needed>
  - Detail 1
  - Detail 2

  ```
- [ ] Commit changes: `git commit -m "message"`
- [ ] Push to remote: `git push`

### Phase 6: Verification
- [ ] Verify commit was successful: `git log -1`
- [ ] Verify push was successful: `git status` should show "up to date"
- [ ] Summarize what was done for the user

**REMEMBER: Code changes without builds, documentation updates, and git commits are incomplete work!**

## Database Schema

The database schema is currently defined manually in `lib/db.ts` using SQLite.

### Future: Lockplane Integration

This project plans to use [Lockplane](https://lockplane.com) for database schema management when migrating to a hosted database (Postgres or hosted SQLite like Turso).

For now:
- Schema is initialized in `lib/db.ts`
- Schema definition exists in `schema/todos.json` for future migration
- When ready to migrate, use Lockplane to apply the schema

## Development Workflow

**ALWAYS FOLLOW THE CHECKLIST ABOVE - NO EXCEPTIONS**

The checklist ensures:
1. Code quality through builds and testing
2. User experience through documentation
3. Version control through git commits
4. Team collaboration through git push

**Common mistake:** Making code changes and forgetting to build, update docs, or commit. This leaves the repository in an inconsistent state.

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (SQLite database will be created automatically)
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Testing & Building

```bash
# Build for production (ALWAYS run before committing)
npm run build

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Lint code (if configured)
npm run lint
```

### Before Committing

**ALWAYS run these commands before pushing:**

```bash
# Build the app (catches TypeScript and build errors)
npm run build

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Format code (if using Prettier)
npm run format

# Lint code (if using ESLint)
npm run lint
```

## Database

This app uses Turso (libSQL/SQLite) for both local and production:
- **Client**: @libsql/client (async)
- **Schema**: Auto-initialized on first request in `lib/db.ts`
- **Lazy Loading**: Database client is created on-demand to support serverless
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` - Database connection URL
  - `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` - Authentication token

### Setting up Turso

1. Install Turso CLI: `curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash`
2. Login: `turso auth login`
3. Create database: `turso db create your-db-name`
4. Get credentials: `turso db show your-db-name`
5. Add to `.env.local` for local development
6. Add to Vercel environment variables for production

## Git Workflow

- Work on `main` branch (small project, no PR workflow yet)
- Always run builds before pushing
- Use descriptive commit messages (see Phase 5 of checklist)
- Always push after committing
- Include `ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)` footer

## Code Organization

- `app/` - Next.js app directory (App Router)
  - `app/api/todos/` - API routes for CRUD operations
  - `app/globals.css` - Global styles
  - `app/layout.tsx` - Root layout
  - `app/page.tsx` - Homepage (client component)
- `lib/` - Utility libraries
  - `lib/db.ts` - Turso/libSQL database client and functions
- `schema/` - Database schema definitions (for future Lockplane migration)
- `public/` - Static assets
- `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Identify which components/files need changes
2. Make code changes
3. Test in dev mode: `npm run dev`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`
5. Update README.md if user-facing
6. **Follow the complete checklist above**

### Adding a New Database Column

1. Update the schema in `lib/db.ts` (ALTER TABLE or recreate)
2. Update TypeScript types in `lib/db.ts`
3. Update API routes to handle the new column
4. Update React components using that data
5. Build and test: `npm run build`
6. **Follow the complete checklist above**

### Fixing a Bug

1. Identify the root cause
2. Make the fix
3. Test the fix in dev mode
4. Build for production: `npm run build`
5. Document the fix in commit message
6. **Follow the complete checklist above**

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting to run `npm run build`** - This is the most common issue. Always build!
2. **Not testing the build** - Errors might only show in production
3. **Forgetting Turso environment variables** - Must set TURSO_DATABASE_URL and TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
4. **Forgetting to update docs** - Documentation must match code
5. **Not committing or pushing** - Work isn't complete until it's pushed
6. **Breaking TypeScript types** - Always fix type errors before committing
7. **Not awaiting async database calls** - Turso uses @libsql/client which is async
8. **Committing `.env.local`** - Keep credentials secret, it's in .gitignore

## Remember

**THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW CHECKLIST AT THE TOP IS MANDATORY**

This is not optional. The checklist ensures:

1. **Documentation stays in sync** - Users can trust the docs match the code
2. **Builds prevent errors** - Changes compile and work correctly
3. **Git history is complete** - All work is tracked and shareable
4. **Remote stays updated** - Team members can see the latest changes

**Incomplete work is:**
- ‚ùå Code changes without running `npm run build`
- ‚ùå Code changes without documentation updates
- ‚ùå Code changes without git commit
- ‚ùå Git commits without git push
- ‚ùå Skipping any step in the checklist
- ‚ùå TypeScript errors in the build

**Complete work is:**
- ‚úÖ All checklist items completed
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds with no errors
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (when implemented)
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Changes committed and pushed
- ‚úÖ User informed of what was done
